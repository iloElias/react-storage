| `fix`      | Bug fixes                                | `fix/button-alignment`      |
| `chore`    | Maintenance and tooling updates          | `chore/update-dependencies` |
| `refactor` | Code refactoring without behavior change | `refactor/auth-module`      |
| `test`     | Add or improve tests                     | `test/api-endpoints`        |

## üîÅ Contribution Workflow

1. **Create a Branch**

   Always create a new branch from the `main` branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/login-page
   ```

2. **Make Commits**

   Commit frequently and clearly, following the guidelines above:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat(auth): add authentication flow"
   ```

3. **Sync Regularly**

   Keep your branch up to date with the base branch to avoid conflicts:

   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

4. **Push and Open a Pull Request**

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/login-page
   ```

   Then, open a Pull Request with a clear and concise description of the changes made and the reasons behind them.

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- **Keep it Focused**: Break large changes into small, manageable pull requests.
- **Explain Why**: Your PR description should explain the reasoning behind your changes.
- **Respect the Style Guide**: Follow the project's coding conventions.
- **Write Tests**: If applicable, include or update tests to cover your changes.
